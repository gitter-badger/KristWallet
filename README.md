## Features
 - Check you Krist Amount on your Android Wear or as a Notification

### Important
This is my first Android App and it can contain Bugs, etc. It's not perfect, but we can make it perfect! Report issues, (fix my broken english), tell me what can be better or send me ideas!

## Used Permissions
 - android.permission.INTERNET:
  - Allows me to access the Internet. As well I only open GitHub.com (Check for Updates once a day) and the Krist API!

## Plans for the future
 - Import [Yivanos KristMiner](https://github.com/Yevano/ytci-krist-miner) so that you mobile can mine.
 - Send Krists over Bluetooth or NFC
 - Fix the Date Error
 - Use R.string.* to translate the App
 - "Are you shure"-Dialog for send Krists
 - Import Updates notes
 - Contributors screen (old (thanks!) and new)
 - Auto-delete APK from Downloads (need android.permisson.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)
 - Choose Address in "Transfere"-Screen to transfere Krists between your accounds
 - **Write me your Ideas!**

Thank you for reading!
