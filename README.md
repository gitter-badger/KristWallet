# KristWallet
A Krist Wallet for Android **[Download Here!](http://timia2109.com/kristWallet.apk)**
**IMPORTANT: On the next update, the download URL will not work because my server dosn't support HTTPS. Please download it when a update is available from here again**

**This App uses classes of [Apemanzilla's KWallet](https://github.com/apemanzilla/KWallet)**

## Features
 - Check you Krist Amount on your Android Wear or as a Notification
 - Check your Transactions
 - Save multiple Krist Wallets
 - Send Krists

### Important
This is my first Android App and it can contain Bugs, etc. It's not perfect, but we can make it perfect! Report issues, (fix my broken english), tell me what can be better or send me ideas!

## Used Permissions
 - android.permission.INTERNET:
  - Allows me to access the Internet. As well I only open GitHub.com (Check for Updates once a day) and the Krist API!

## Plans for the future
 - Import [Yivanos KristMiner](https://github.com/Yevano/ytci-krist-miner) so that you mobile can mine.
 - Send Krists over Bluetooth or NFC
 - Fix the Date Error

Thank you for reading!
